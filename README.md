Project Overview:
Key Facial Points Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying specific facial features from images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project involves creating a model to predict key points on facial images, which can be used for various applications such as emotion detection, face recognition, and augmented reality.

Features:
Facial Key Point Detection: Detects key points on faces in images, including eyes, nose, and mouth corners.
Preprocessing and Augmentation: Includes data normalization and augmentation techniques to improve model accuracy.
Deep Learning: Utilizes CNNs for feature extraction and point prediction.
Visualization: Provides visualizations for detected key points on facial images.
Data Augmentation: Includes flipping, scaling, and rotating images to enhance model generalization.
Model Checkpointing: Saves the best-performing models during training.
Result Visualization: Displays key points on sample images for performance evaluation.

Results
After training the model, you can expect to see the predicted key points on facial images, with visualizations showing how well the model has performed.
Training Loss and Accuracy: Check the model's performance metrics during training.
Visualization of Key Points: The notebook includes functions to visualize the results on sample images.
